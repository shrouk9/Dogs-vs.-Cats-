Developing a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Step-by-Step to Classify images of Dogs and Cats
in this project I trained a Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to predict whether the image is of cat or dog by training the algorithm with dataset consisting of images of cats and dogs. Later test data will be used to predict whether the image choosen is of cat or dog.

# **Workflow**

- Gather the data i.e image dataset.

- Explore the images.

- Prepare Training&Validation Data.

- Define the CNN model.

- Training the model.
- 
- Save the Model.

- Capturing the predictions and labelling the predictions whether cat or dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

# **Dataset Description**

The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Train your algorithm on these files and predict the labels for test1.zip (1 = dog, 0 = cat).
